											<h3 class="major">Cosmic Loop - 2D Retro Platformer</h3>
											<p>My game is a thrilling adventure that challenges players to overcome various obstacles and enemies in order to progress. With three levels that increase in difficulty, players are introduced to new gameplay elements that keep the game fresh and engaging. The final level features a climactic boss fight designed to test the player's skills to their limits. In the game, players are able to run, jump, and shoot their way through the obstacles and enemies. However, strategic thinking is key to success, as players must use the obstacles and enemies to their advantage in order to progress.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Augmented Reality for Interior Design</h3>
											<p>My augmented reality app revolutionizes the interior design industry by allowing users to virtually place furniture in a real-world environment. By scanning an image target with a mobile device's camera, users can render virtual furniture into their physical space. The app's intuitive interface allows users to interact with the 3D object in a variety of ways, such as changing its color, adjusting its size, and rotating it to view it from different angles. This innovative app offers a seamless user experience that empowers customers to make informed purchasing decisions and visualize how furniture will look in their space before making a purchase.</p>

											<h3 class="major">FileGenics - Productivity App</h3>
											<p>My team and I developed a productivity-based application called FileGenics, designed to streamline workflows and simplify file management within a work environment. The app offers a range of features and tools, such as file transfer via QR code, in-app messaging, file compression, and file upload. To ensure seamless functionality, we integrated the app with Firebase database, enabling users to securely upload and download files to and from the cloud. The app's intuitive interface and advanced functionality make it an ideal solution for professionals seeking a reliable and efficient file management tool.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Yung Anomaly - Streetwear Brand</h3>
											<p>As an entrepreneur, I launched my own e-commerce brand, which provided me with valuable insights into running a small business. This personal project opened up several opportunities, including invitations to local events to showcase my brand, setting up pop-up shops, and building a client list. By sharing my knowledge and expertise, I helped individuals with their own e-commerce businesses and continue to do so. Through this experience, I honed my customer service skills, developed a keen business acumen, and gained proficiency in organising and executing business plans.</p>
